Stock Lot - Grouped SUM for Non-Stored Computed Fields
======================================================

This module extends Odoo's default grouping behavior by enabling SUM
aggregation on non-stored computed fields like `product_qty` in the
`stock.lot` model. Odoo normally cannot aggregate such fields at the SQL
level, so this module computes them manually in Python and injects them
into grouped list view results.

Key Features:
-------------
- Supports `product_qty:sum` in list view groupings.
- Python-level SUM calculation for computed fields.
- Seamless integration with standard read_group behavior.
